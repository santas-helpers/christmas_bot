# CHRISTMAS_BOT
It’s a frosty winter night. As you warm up by the fire, you hear a faint jingle in the distance. You look out your window and see a strange silhouette over the moon. Is that… Santa Claus? But it’s not Christmas yet! Apparently, Santa is taking a vacation this year, and he needs your help to determine who’s naughty and who’s nice!
